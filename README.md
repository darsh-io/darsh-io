## how to exist like me

- live in singapore
- know python
- know just enough js/html/css to not be considered illiterate
- enjoy electronics (esp32, arduino, raspberry pi)
- be too deeply invested in pc hardware
- love games but barely have time to play them

---

## notable stuff

- built a custom tetralayered cipher (excellent at wasting mobile data)
- made / co-made some interesting "advantages" in games
- built a fast-paced 2D local 1v1 game in unity
- made a few ~~horrible~~ experimental AIs
- built random things with lego 51515
- created a program that turns any computer into a ~~fire hazard~~ space heater which definitely isnt a fork bomb

## currently learning

- c#
- linux fundamentals

## currently building

- a rubik's cube solving algorithm  
  (previous attempt relied on a premade solution — this one won’t)

---

## fun facts

ps: please stop using openclaw. it uses so much AI that companies will think demand is higher, buy more RAM, and then DDR5 prices go up again. i'm watching you. RAHHHHHHH
